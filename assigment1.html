<h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
<p>Dear Eileen</p>
<p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's
     science faculty to study as part of your PhD) next year,
     I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections</p>
<strong>Starting dates</strong>
<p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you

    could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016 </li>
        <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer</p>
    <p>You can find more information about <a href="http//google.com" target="_blank">important university states </a>on our website.</p>
    <strong>Subjects of study</strong>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility as long as the subjects fail
 somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just
        the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued
by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
    <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the
ience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>) </li>
    <li><abbr title="hyper text">HTML</abbr>, and <abbr title="cascadingStyleSheet"> css</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores</li>
</ol>
<p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the

    research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
</p>
<strong>Exotic dance moves</strong>
<p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. 
    To answer your question my favourite dances are as follows,
     with definitions: 
    Polynesian chicken dance

    A little known but very influential dance dting back as far as 300BC. a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens,
     to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</p>
     <p>Icelandic brownian shuffle</p>
     <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which                 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny,
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; very rapid movements.</p>
        <p>polynesian chicken dance</p>
     <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which                 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny,
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; very rapid movements.</p>
        <p>Artic robot dance</p>
     <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which                 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny,
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; very rapid movements.</p>
                     One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking
